Lukas has an exceptional ability to see the bigger picture while staying deeply involved in the details that make a digital project succeed. Lukas drove several major initiatives that truly transformed the company’s digital presence — including the complete relaunch of the corporate website and the launch of the Medartis ONE app. He approaches every project with vision, structure, and an impressive understanding of both technology and digital marketing. What always impressed me most was his broad knowledge across disciplines — from web technologies to marketing automation, UX, and analytics. He consistently connected these areas into cohesive strategies that pushed the company forward. He’s a true digital all-rounder with vision and integrity, and I’m very grateful for the time I got to work with him."},

Lukas combines deep technical and anatomical understanding with an empathetic, people-first leadership style that makes collaboration both productive and genuinely enjoyable. He played a key role in shaping Medartis’ digital transformation — leading the complete relaunch of the company’s website and orchestrating Medartis ONE, the first true Medartis app, which he guided from concept to launch. His ability to connect innovation, technology, and medical insight is rare, and he consistently turns complex ideas into clear, user-focused solutions. Lukas knows the Microsoft ecosystem inside out — SharePoint, Lists, Team Planner, automation, Jira, and beyond — and uses it to bring structure, flow, and efficiency to every process. What stands out most, though, is his leadership: fair, transparent, and constructive, always encouraging open dialogue and shared ownership. He’s not only a forward-thinking innovator and strong communicator but also an educator and connector who genuinely values knowledge sharing and teamwork. Lukas is one of those leaders who elevate both projects and people — and someone I truly enjoyed working with."},

Lukas successfully led a team of more than eight people and always brought a high level of commitment, motivation, and positive energy to every challenge. He has an outstanding understanding of the company, its products, people, and processes, and he always managed to connect the dots between them. Collaborating with him was truly a pleasure. Losing such a dedicated and knowledgeable colleague is a real loss for the company — and for me personally as well."}
